코드는 main이 아닌 각 branch에 팀원이 분담한 것을 나누어 놓았습니다.

## 2. Program configuration


 It recognizes the movement and behavior of the student's face and analyzes the student's concentration and understanding. And the results of the analysis are communicated to the educator to help flexible lectures and provide feedback on the class.



## 3. Key features

It is a high-accuracy system by measuring through analysis of behavioral patterns and facial movements when grasping concentration and understanding.

As a result of conducting a survey to classify behavior during analysis, the following behaviors appear when the content of the class is not understood.

* Tilt your head.
* Frown your brows.
* Get closer to the screen.
* Hands go to my head or face.

Based on our survey results, we consider these 5 behaviors to be behaviors that occur when we don't understand them. If it is judged that at least one of the five behaviors is the result of recognizing students' behavior and facial movements, it is classified as not understood.
